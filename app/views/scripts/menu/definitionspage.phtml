<h3><b>DATA SOURCES</b></h3><br/>
<h4><b>DHIS-2</b></h4>
             </div>
 <div class="alignment">                           
     <p>The Nigeria Family Planning Dashboard connects to Nigeria’s National Health Management Information System (NHMIS) platform, DHIS-2, which collects commodity information at the facility level. The Dashboard facilitates the direct and automatic transfer of data from DHIS-2 every month, thus allowing data that already exists to be transferred into the system with minimal effort and minimal data entry errors. This data transfer occurs on the 25th of each month, at which point all data for the prior month is uploaded. For example, on March 25th, all data for February is uploaded to the Dashboard from DHIS-2. This corresponds to the DHIS-2 reporting schedule, whereby monthly data should be entered by the 25th of the following month, and accommodates for some late reporting. Because DHIS-2 is updated in real time, there may be slight temporary differences in the data found on DHIS-2 and the data found on the Dashboard at any given time. Full data back ups, including historical data that may have been updated in DHIS-2 at a later date, will occur quarterly in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on the Dashboard.</p>
    <br/> <p>In calculating the percentage of facilities providing a service or stocking out, the Family Planning Dashboard charts only include data on facilities that have reported to DHIS-2, meaning their monthly entry was marked “complete” in DHIS-2.  Because M&E officers must log a facility entry as complete in the DHIS-2 in order for the facility to be marked as reporting, this occasionally results in discrepancies if some data were entered but the facility was not logged as complete. HISP Nigeria is working to solve this problem. State or LGA-wide consumption data includes all consumption, regardless of reporting status. Queries return all facilities and will indicate reporting, so that users can determine their own parameters with respect to reporting for offline analysis.</p>
    <br/> <p>The list of facilities and their geographic components (LGA, State, Zone) are also pulled directly from DHIS-2 and, as a result, the number of facilities included in the Dashboard calculations varies from month to month based on which facilities reported in that month.  The full list of DHIS-2 facilities can be found in the “Facility Data” function of the Reports menu.</p>

<br/>
 </div>
     <div>
<h4><b>Human Resources (HR) Database</b></h4></div>
 <div class="alignment">
     <p>The main source of HR data for the Dashboard is through a standard Excel FMOH FP Training template submitted by training organizations to the Federal and State Ministries of Health. Training organizations are responsible for sending updated templates immediately following training activities and at the end of each quarter. The State FP Coordinator is then responsible for uploading the HR data into the Dashboard using the “Add New Training” module upon receipt of updated data forms. The template can be automatically uploaded into the Dashboard, or the data collected on this form can be manually entered into the Dashboard. All data collection is subject to data quality checks, such as checking against the DHIS-2 list of facilities, and ensuring health worker qualification, type of training, etc. are selected from a pre-approved list based on FMOH standards, to ensure the correctness and meaningfulness of the data collected. State FP Coordinators are also responsible for updating individual health worker data if, for example, a health worker moves to a different facility either within or outside of the state. Facility data associated with a health worker therefore should represent the health workers current location, not the location where they were trained.</p>
 </div>
                                    
 <br/><div><h4><b>Health Worker Training Targets</b></h4></div>
 <div class="alignment">
<p>Health worker training targets are set by the Federal Ministry of Health of Nigeria and should be updated periodically. Currently, the targets are: </p><br/>
<div class="alignment"><ul>	
        <li>Year 1 (2013): 12 states – 1,784 health workers trained in LARC</li><br/>
        <li>Year 2 (2014): 12 states – 1,784 health workers trained in LARC</li><br/>
        <li>Year 3 (2015): 13 states – 1,932 health workers trained in LARC</li><br/>
        <li>Total: 5,500 health workers trained in LARC by 2015</li><br/>
